## What's this site?

This is Sharzy's personal blog, used to record something I find interesting, updated randomly. 

I am a CS student with MO background, as well as a anime, music lover (just a listener). 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/SharzyL), [Bangumi](https://bangumi.tv/user/430803),
or [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=91540849) (Welcome for following),   
or contact me via telegram ([@RhoveL](https://t.me/RhoveL)), 
e-mail ([sharzyluo@outlook.com](mailto:sharzyluo@outlook.com)).


## How is this built?
I write articles in `markdown` and converted them to `html` by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 
The pages are hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). 
You can view the source code on
 this [Github repo](https://github.com/SharzyL/SharzyL.github.io). 
 
Thanks for the developers of these utilities, which makes it much easier to construct such a site:

- [gitalk](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk)
