## What's this site?

This is Sharzy's personal blog, used to record something I find interesting, updated randomly. 

I am a CS student with MO background, as well as a anime, music lover (just a listener). 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/SharzyL), [Bangumi](https://bangumi.tv/user/430803),
or [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=91540849) (Welcome for following),   
or contact me by telegram (@RhoveL), e-mail (sharzyluo@outlook.com).


## How is this built?
This blog website is hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). 
I use `markdown` to write articles and use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate blog pages. 
You can view the source code of this website on
 this [Github repo](https://github.com/SharzyL/SharzyL.github.io).
