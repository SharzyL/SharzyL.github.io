# What's this site?

This is Sharzy's personal blog, used to record something I find interesting, updated randomly. 

I am a CS student with MO background, as well as a anime, music lover (just a listener). 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/SharzyL), [Bangumi](https://bangumi.tv/user/430803),
or [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=91540849) (Welcome for following), or contact me via telegram ([@SharzyL](https://t.me/SharzyL)), 
e-mail ([me@sharzy.in](mailto:me@sharzy.in)).


# How is this built?
I write articles in `markdown` and converted them to `html` by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 
The pages are hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). 
You can view the source code on `source` branch of 
 this [Github repo](https://github.com/SharzyL/SharzyL.github.io). 
 
Due to my limited CSS skill, some features are hidden on mobile devices to avoid display disorder. 
So reading on wide screen devices is more recommended. 
 
Thanks for the developers of these utilities, which makes it much easier to construct such a site: 
- [Responsive navigation](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js)
- [gitalk](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk)
- [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
- [zooming.js](https://desmonding.me/zooming/)
