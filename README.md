## What's this site?

This is Sharzy's personal blog, used to record something I find interesting, updated randomly. 

## How is this built?

I write articles in `markdown` and converted them to `html` by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 
The pages are hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). 
You can view the source code on
 this [Github repo](https://github.com/SharzyL/SharzyL.github.io). 

Thank for the developers of these utilities, which makes it much easier to construct such a site:

- [gitalk](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk)
- [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
- [zooming.js](https://desmonding.me/zooming/)
