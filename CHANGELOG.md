## [1.0] - 2020.5.21

In this version, I introduce a brand new Material Design-based design for my blog. 

### Changed

- Change the primary design paradigm from flat design to material design. Use shadowed card and gray background for content stratification and horizontal line for content partition. 
- Use  `position: sticky`  for sidebar positioning instead of manipulating it manually by JavaScript. 
- Return to pure blue background for header, instead of `linear-gradient` background. 
- Design the article as a card and protrude it into the header. In this way we can set any picture for header background without worrying about color mixing. 
- Rearrange layout hierarchy to make it less intricate. 
- Tinker the style of `gitalk` to make it look cleaner. 
- Adjust text in `404.html` .
- Fine-tune the font-size of html titles and navigation bar. 
- Change the Horizontal positioning and sizing rule for sidebar. 
- Change the color of sticky navigation bar from semi-transparent to pure white. 

### Removed

- Subtitle of the homepage. 

## [1.0.1] - 2020.5.22

### Added
